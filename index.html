            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>I am a junior in the University of Michigan School of Information studying Information Analysis with a minor in Computer Science, taking courses including Data Manipulation, Sports Analytics, and Data Structures and Algorithms. I am passionate about using data to find solutions to meaningful problems.
                Outside of school I work as a data analyst for the Michigan Men's Basketball team, conduct research in learning analytics visualization, and serve as student body Vice President.

            <p>This site is my portfolio of basketball data-related projects that are a product of my work with the Michigan Basketball team, the Michigan Basketball Analytics Association, or out of a burning need to find an answer to various questions that come up while watching games.
                I hope to continue to update this site as I complete more projects in this space. Contact me to discuss any projects or Marcus Smart's uncanny ability to chase down a loose ball.
