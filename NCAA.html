			<p>The 2021 NCAA Tournament 1st round had what seems like a historic amount of upsets, but just how historic was it? I went back to 1985 when the NCAA moved its tournament to 64 teams and took 
				the sum of seeds (from 1-16) for all of the teams that made the second round. Turns out 2021 is the second highest of all time, coming just 5 seed points behind 2016, another year with a  historically
				surprising first round.
